  - Two-pointer technique is used for searching and is commonly applied to solve coding problems related to strings, arrays, and linked lists.
  
  - Understanding the algorithm is important because it can significantly reduce time complexity from O(n^2) or O(n^3) to O(n) when the data structure is ordered.

  - Two variants of the two-pointer technique: Opposite Direction and Equalization.
  
  - Opposite Direction: Two pointers start at opposite ends of the data and move towards each other until a condition is met.
  
  - Equalization: Both pointers start at the same end, one as a slow pointer and the other as a fast pointer, used in sliding window problems.

  - Given a sorted array, find two numbers that sum up to a specific target.
  
  - Use two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end, and adjust them to find the target sum efficiently.

  - Find the maximum sum of a continuous subarray of size K in an array.
  
  - Utilize a sliding window approach with two pointers, one for adding new elements and one for removing old elements.
